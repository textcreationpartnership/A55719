            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Again, Thoſe large Scopes of Land, and great Liberties, with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Power to make War and Peace, did raiſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords to that height of Pride and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as they could not endure one another, but grew to a mortal War and Diſſention amongſt themſelves; inſomuch, that whole Towns and Countries have often times been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by their Contentions, which brought forth divers miſchiefs that did not onely diſable the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to finiſh the Conqueſt of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> but did endanger the loſs of what was already gained; And of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, made themſelves Slaves to that Nation, which they did intend to Conquer.

            <p>Beſides, The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords to ſtrengthen their Parties, did Ally themſelves with the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and drew

               <note place="margin">Why the Kings of <hi>England</hi> Granted ſuch large Proportions of Land to the firſt Conquerors of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note>But this ought withal to be taken into conſideration, that as theſe Grants of little Kingdomes, and great Royalties, to a few private perſons, did produce the miſchiefs ſpoken of before: So the true cauſe of making thoſe Grants, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from this; That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> being otherwiſe imployed, and diverted, did not make the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> their own work, and undertook it not royally at their own charge; but as it was firſt begun by particular Adventurers, ſo they left the proſecution thereof to them, and other Adventurers, who came to ſeek their Fortunes in <hi>Ireland;</hi> wherein if they could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, they thought it in Reaſon and Honor, they could do no leſs than make them Proprietors of ſuch Scopes of Land as they could Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, People and Plant at their own charge, reſerving only the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lordſhip to the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> But if the Lyon had gone to hunt himſelf, the ſhares of the

If the Invaſion had been made by an Army, tranſmitted, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and ſupplyed onely at the Kings charges, and wholly paid with the Kings Treaſure, as the Armies of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> were, as the Conqueſt had been ſooner atchieved, ſo the Servitors had been contented with leſſer proportions.</p>
            <p>For when <hi>Scipio, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> and other Generals of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Armies, as Subjects and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of that State, and with the Publick Charge, had Conquered many Kingdomes and Common-Weals, we find them rewarded with Honorable Offices and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs at their return; and not made Lords and Proprietors of whole Provinces and Kingdomes, which they had ſubdued to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Rome.</hi> Likewiſe, when the Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> had Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>England,</hi> which he made his own work, and perform'd it in his own perſon, he diſtributed ſundry Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Manners unto his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42941:32"/> but gave not away whole Shires and Countries in Demeſne to any of his Servitors, whom he moſt deſired to advance.</p>
            <p>Again, From the time of the <hi>Norman</hi> Conqueſt, till the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, many of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords made War upon the <hi>Welch-men,</hi> at their own charge; the Lands which they gained, they held to their own uſe, were called Lords Marchers, and had Royal Liberties within their Lordſhips. Howbeit theſe particular Adventurers could never make a Conqueſt of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt came in perſon with his Army thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, kept his Reſidence and Court there; made the reducing of <hi>Wales</hi> an enterprize of his own; he finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that work in a Year or two, whereof the Lords Marchers had not perform'd a third part, with their continual Bordering War, for two hundred Years. And withall we may obſerve, that though this King had now the Dominion of <hi>Wales, in jure proprietatis,</hi> (as the Statute of <hi>Rutland</hi> affirmeth) which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42941:32"/> before was ſubject unto him, but in <hi>jure feodali:</hi> And though he had loſt divers principal Knights and Noble men in that War, yet did he not reward his Servitors with whole Countries or Counties, but with particular Mannors and Lordſhips: As to <hi>Henry Lacie,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> he gave the Lordſhip of <hi>Denbigh;</hi> and to <hi>Reighnold Gray,</hi> the Lordſhip of <hi>Ruthen,</hi> and ſo to others.</p>
            <p>If the like courſe had been uſed in the winning and diſtribuiting of the Lands of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Iſland had been fully conquered before the Continent of <hi>Wales</hi> had been redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But the truth is, when pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men attempt the Conqueſt of Countries at their own charge, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly their enterprizes do periſh without ſucceſs: as when in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> undertook to recover the <hi>Ardes:</hi> and <hi>Chatterton,</hi> to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the <hi>Fues,</hi> and <hi>Orier.</hi> The one loſt his Son; and the other himſelf; and both their Adventures came to nothing.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42941:33"/> in the Conqueſt of this Land, as ſome Purchaſers have; who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to buy Land at too eaſie a Rate: they find thoſe cheap Purchaſers ſo full of trouble, as they ſpend twice as much as the Land is worth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they get the quiet poſſeſſion thereof.</p>

            <p>Having thus far recounted the manifold defects, miſchiefs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments that both in the Civil and Martial Affairs ſo long obſtructed the ful Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſhould have here alſo briefly recited the many good Laws and Ordinances made and enacted from time to time, by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and the Parliaments in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the ſaid miſchiefs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; but all fair endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and purpoſes of this kind proving abortive and ineffectual, for want of the Sovereign Sword, as well as the Royal Scepter to put the ſame in execution; I ſhall now onely ſet forth the Nature of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cuſtoms, with the evil Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereof; and then proceed to a concluſion of this diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thoſe Affairs that ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear moſt remarkable in the reigns

            <p>If we conſider the Nature of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cuſtoms,<note place="margin">The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> we ſhall find that the people which doth uſe them, muſt of neceſſity be Rebels to all good Government, deſtroy the Common-Wealth wherein they live, and bring Barbariſme and Deſolation upon the richeſt and moſt fruitful Land of the World. For whereas by the juſt and honorable Law of <hi>England,</hi> and by the Laws of all other well governed Kingdoms and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, <hi>Murder, Manſlaughter, Rape, Robbery</hi> and <hi>Theft,</hi> are puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with Death; By the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, or <hi>Brehen</hi> Law, the higheſt of theſe offences was puniſhed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Fine, which they called an <hi>Erick.</hi> Therefore, when Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Fitz-Williams</hi> (being <hi>Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty</hi>) told <hi>Maguire</hi> that he was to ſend a Sheriff into <hi>Farmannagh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

As for Oppreſſion, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, and other treſpaſſes, the weaker had never any remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtronger: whereby it came to paſs, that no man could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his Life, his Wife, his Lands or Goods in ſafety; if a mightier man then himſelf had an appetite to take the ſame from him. Wherein they were little better then <hi>Cannibals,</hi> who do hunt one another, and he that hath moſt ſtrength and ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, doth eat and devour all his followers.</p>
            <p>Again, In <hi>England</hi> and all well ordered Common-wealths, men have certain Eſtates in their Lands and poſſeſſions, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances deſcend from Father to Son, which doth give them an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Build, and Plant, and to improve their Lands, and to make them better for their Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

Where, leaſt I be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as your Lordſhips have been lately, I muſt of neceſſity put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Inhabitants of this Nation: ſome of them are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended of the Race of the antient <hi>Engliſh;</hi> or otherwiſe hold their Eſtates from the Crown, and have Poſſeſſions of their own to ſtick to, who eaſily may be truſted againſt a forreign Invader, although they differ from the State in matter of Religion: for proof of which fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this kind (he ſaith) he need go no farther, than the late Wars in the time of the Earl of <hi>Tyrone;</hi> wherein they were aſſaulted with as powerful Temptations, to move them from their Loyalty, as poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42941:45"/> could be afterwards preſented unto them; for at that time, not only the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelf with the Rebels, and landed his Forces at <hi>Kingſale</hi> for their aſſiſtance: but the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo, with his <hi>Breves</hi> and <hi>Bulls</hi> ſollicited the Nobility, and Gentry of <hi>Ireland</hi> to Revolt from their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Queen, declaring that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did fight againſt the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> Religion, and ought to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned as much as the <hi>Turks;</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the ſame favours, to ſuch as ſhould ſet upon them, as he doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch as fight againſt the <hi>Turks;</hi> and finally, promiſing unto them, that the God of Peace would tread down their Enemies under their feet ſpeedily. And yet for all the Popes promiſes and threatnings, which were alſo ſeconded by a Declatati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divines of <hi>Salamanca</hi> and <hi>Valledolid,</hi> not only the Lords and Gentlemen, did conſtantly continue their Allegiance to the Queen, but were alſo encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo to do by the Prieſts of the <hi>Pale,</hi> that were of Popiſh Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42941:45"/> who were therefore vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taxed by the Traytor <hi>Suellevan,</hi> for exhorting them to follow the Queens ſide; which he is pleaſed to term <hi>Inſanam &amp; venenoſam Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, &amp; tartareum Dogma,</hi> a mad and venemous Doctrine, and a hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Opinion.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe, there were a great number of <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who either bore a ſecret grudge againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> planted among them; or having nothing at all to loſe, upon the firſt occaſion, are apt to joyn with any forraign Invader; for we have not uſed that pollicie in our Plantations that wiſe States have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in former times.

               <p>I have already declared how it is moſt probable that the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Iſland came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>Britain,</hi>

The <hi>Brehon</hi> Law, by which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> governed themſelves, was a Rule of Right unwritten, but delivered by Tradition from one to another, in which often times there appeared great ſhew of Equity, in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Right between party and party; but in many things repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning quite both to Gods Law and Mans:<note place="margin">The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and impiety of the <hi>Brehon Iriſh</hi> Law.</note> As for example in the caſe of Murder, the <hi>Brehon,</hi> that is their Judge, would compound between
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42941:69"/> the Murderer, and the Friends of the party Murdered which Proſecuted the Action, that the Malefactor ſhould give unto them, or to the Child or Wife of him that is ſlain, a recompence, which they called an <hi>Eriach:</hi> By which <hi>vile</hi> Law of theirs, many Murders amongſt them were made up and ſmothered. And this Judge being as he was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Lords <hi>Brehon,</hi> adjudged for the moſt part, a better ſhare unto this Lord, that is the Lord of the Soil, or the head of that Sept, and alſo unto himſelf for his judgment a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter portion, then unto the Plaintiffs or parties grieved.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> the beſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the Laws of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note>He that gave the faireſt beginning to the Reformation of the Laws of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of any till his time, was Sir <hi>Edward Poynings,</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, who finding in that Realm nothing but a common miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, took the beſt courſe he poſſibly could to eſtabliſh there a well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Common-wealth: and to that end he held a Parliament no leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, than that of <hi>Kilkenny;</hi> and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42941:69"/> more available for the Reformation of the whole Kingdom. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all wiſe men did ever concur in opinion, that the readieſt way to Reform <hi>Ireland,</hi> was to ſettle a form of Civil Government there, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to that of <hi>England:</hi> To bring this to paſs, Sir <hi>Edward Poynings</hi> did paſs an Act, whereby all the Statutes made in <hi>England</hi> before that time, were enacted, eſtabliſhed, and made of force in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he only reſpect the time paſt, but provided alſo for the time to come. For he cauſed an other Law to be made, that no Act ſhould be propounded in any Parliament of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but ſuch as ſhould be firſt Tranſmitted into <hi>England,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the King and Council there, as good and expedient for that Land, and ſo returned back again, under the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> This Act, though it ſeem <hi>Prima facie</hi> to reſtrain the Liberty of the Subjects of <hi>Ireland;</hi> yet was it made at the Prayer of the Commons, upon juſt and important cauſe.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:42941:70"/>
               <p>For the Governors of that Realm, eſpecially ſuch as were of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Birth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Poynings</hi> Act made at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the Commons of <hi>Ireland</hi>
                  </note> had laid many opprſſions upon the Commons: And amongſt the reſt they had impoſed Laws up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, not tending to the general good, but to ſerve private turns, and to ſtrengthen their particular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. This moved them to refer all Laws, that were to be paſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be conſidered, corrected, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, firſt by the State of <hi>England</hi> which had alwaies been tender and careful of the good of this people, and had long ſince made them a Civil, Rich, and Happy Nation, if their own Lords and Governors there, had not ſent bad intelligence into <hi>England.</hi> Beſides this, he took ſpecial Order, that the Summons of Parliament ſhould go into all the Shires of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not to the four Shires onely within the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pale; (for out of that little Precinct there were no Lords, Knights or Burgeſſes, Summoned to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; neither did the Kings Writ run in any other part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) and for that cauſe ſpecially,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42941:70"/> he cauſed all the Acts of Parliament, lately before holden by the Viſcount of <hi>Gormanſton</hi> to be repealed and made void. On theſe foundations they have raiſed many ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures both of Law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, enacted in their own Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſummoned by the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty at the Kings appointment. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many inconveniences which have been obſerved in the Laws of <hi>England</hi> in relation to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ireland</hi> (whereof a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was wiſht) this was a main one; That when any of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> intended to go into Rebellion,<note place="margin">Entailing of Lands ſupported the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </note> they would convey away all their Lands, and Lordſhips to Feoffees in truſt, whereby they reſerved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but a State for term of life; which being determined by the ſword, or by the halter, their Lands ſtraight came to their heirs, and the Crown of <hi>England</hi> defrauded of the intent of the Law, which laid that grievous puniſhment upon Traytors, to forfeit all their Lands to the Prince, to the end that men might the rather be terrified from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42941:71"/> treaſons, for many which would little eſteem of their own lives, yet for remorſe of their Wives and Children would be with-held from that heinous crime. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared plainly in the late Earl of <hi>Deſmond.</hi> For before his breaking forth into open Rebellion, he had conveyed ſecretly all his Lands to Feoffees of truſt, in hope to have cut off her Majeſty from the Eſcheat of his Lands; which inconvenience, though well enough avoided at that time by an Act of Parliament (ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with much difficulty) which (by cutting off, and fruſtrating all ſuch conveyances as had at any time by the ſpace of twelve years before his Rebellion, been made, within the compaſs whereof, the fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Feoffment, and many the like of others his accomplices and fellow traytors were contained) gave all his Lands to the Queen; yet were it not an endleſs trouble (ſuppoſing ſuch Acts were eaſily brought to paſs) that no Traitor or Fellon ſhould be attainted, but a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42941:71"/> muſt be called for bringing of his Lands to the Crown which the Law giveth it.</p>
               <p>Although ſince the time of St. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick (Anno</hi> 430) Chriſtianity was never extinct in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Religion.</note> yet the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being hailed into contrary factions, the Nobility lawleſs, the multitude wilful, it came to paſs that Religion waxed with the temporal common ſort cold and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, untill the Conqueſt by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second did ſettle it. The Honourable ſtate of Marriage they much abuſed, either in contracts, unlawful meetings, the Levitical and Canonical degrees of prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in divorcements at pleaſure, or in omitting Sacramental ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or in retaining either Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines or Harlots for Wives: yea, where the Clergy were faint, they could be content to Marry for a year and a day of probation, and at the years end, to return her home upon any light quarrels, if the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomans friends were weak and unable to avenge the injury. Never was there heard of ſo many diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42941:72"/> for Marriage, as thoſe men ſhow, I pray God grant they were all authentick, and builded upon ſufficient warrant.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> about the latter end of Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> Reign, and the cauſes of it.</note>About the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> was infeſted, not onely with groſs <hi>Symony,</hi> greedy covetouſneſs, fleſhly incontinency, careleſs ſloath, and generally a diſordered life in the common Clergy-men: But beſides all theſe had their particular enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſts, which then enjoyed the Church-livings, were in a manner meer Lay-men, ſaving that they had taken holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but otherwiſe they did go, and live like Lay-men, follow all kind of Husbandry, and other world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affairs, as other <hi>Iriſh</hi> men did. They neither read Scriptures, nor preach to the People, nor adminiſter Communion, but Baptiſm they did: for they Chriſtened then after the Popiſh faſhion, onely they took the Tithes and Offerings, and gathered what fruit elſe they might of their Livings, the which they converted as badly, and ſome of them (they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42941:72"/> ſaid) paid as due Tributes and Shares of their Livings to their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (I mean thoſe which were <hi>Iriſh</hi>) as they received them duly.</p>
               <p>Which ſhameful abuſes the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Governours could not redreſs, becauſe they knew not the parties ſo offending; for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Biſhops had their Clergy in ſuch aw and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under them, that they durſt not complain of them, ſo as they might do to them what they pleaſed, for they knowing their own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and incapacity, and that they were ſtill removeable at their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops will, yielded to what pleaſed him, and he took what he liſted: yea, and ſome of them whoſe Dioceſſes were in remote parts, ſomewhat out of the Worlds eye, did not at all beſtow the Benefices, which were in their own donation, upon any, but kept them in their own hands, and did ſet their own Servants and horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys to take up the Tithes and Fruits of them; with the which, ſome of them purchaſed great Lands, and built fair Caſtles upon the ſame. Of which abuſe, if any queſtion
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42941:73"/> were moved, they had a very ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colour and excuſe, that they had no worthy Miniſters to beſtow them upon, but kept them ſo unbeſtowed for any ſuch ſufficient perſon, as ſhould be offered unto them.</p>
               <p>To meet with this miſchief, there was a Statute enacted in <hi>Ireland</hi> which ſeems to have been grounded upon a good meaning; That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> of good conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and ſufficiency, ſhould be brought to any of the Biſhops, and nominated unto any Living, within their Dioceſs that were preſently void, that he ſhould (without any contradiction) be admitted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, before any <hi>Iriſh:</hi> which good Law, though it had been well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and that none of the Biſhops had tranſgreſſed the ſame, yet it wrought no Reformation thereof for many defects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there were no ſuch ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters ſent over as might be preſented to any Biſhop for any Living; but the moſt part of ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> as came over thither of themſelves, were either unlearned,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42941:73"/> or men of ſome bad note, for which they had forſaken <hi>England.</hi> So as the Biſhop to whom they ſhould have been preſented, might juſtly reject them as incapable and inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. Secondly, the Biſhop himſelf being perhaps an <hi>Iriſh man</hi> who being made Judge by that Law, of the ſufficiency of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, might at his own Will, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of the <hi>Engliſh man,</hi> as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in his Opinion, and admit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Iriſh,</hi> whom he ſhould think more for his turn. And if he ſhould at the Inſtance of any <hi>Engliſh man</hi> of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance there, whom he would not diſpleaſe, accept of any ſuch <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Miniſter as ſhould be tendered unto him, yet he would under-hand, carry ſuch a hard hand over him, or by his Officers wring him ſo ſore, that he would ſoon make him wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his poor Living. Laſtly, the Benefices themſelves were ſo mean, and of ſo ſmall profit in thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> Countreys, through the ill husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> people which did inhabit them, that they would not yeild any competent maintenance
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42941:74"/> for any honeſt Miniſter to live upon, ſcarcely to buy him a Gown.

               <p>Thus was the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt ſweetly tempered, and carryed on with great lenity and moderation; the Lords Juſtices and Councel wholly departing from the rigour of former courſes, did gently unbend themſelves into a happy and juſt compliance with the ſeaſonable deſires of the people. And his Majeſty, that he might farther teſtify his own ſettled reſolution for the continuation thereof, with the ſame tender hand over them, having firſt given full ſatisfaction in all things to the ſaid Committee of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſtill attending their diſpatch, did about the latter end of <hi>May</hi> 1641. declare <hi>Kobert</hi> Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> Lord Lieutenant General of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> He was Heir to Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> his Unckle,

               <p>It hath been ſaid (of late) by ſome,<note place="margin">Number of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</note> that the people of <hi>England</hi> are quadrubled, within four hundred years, as doubling every two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years: How true this may be in relation to <hi>England</hi> I know not; but I am perſwaded that this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation may be more properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to <hi>Ireland,</hi> which has been
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42941:89"/> (within theſe four hundred years) mightily improved by clearing of grounds from a Wilderneſs, and thereby conſequently giving way for the enlargment of peoples Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Ireland</hi> being reported to be generally overgrown with Woods in <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis</hi> his time. Though <hi>Ireland</hi> was very populous before the laſt War, and is compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be half as big as <hi>England,</hi> yet I dare not ſay that it contained half as many people as <hi>England</hi> did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe above one fourth part of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is taken up with unprofitable Boggs, Lakes and barren Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; and for that the Towns Cities of <hi>England</hi> are far greater and more numerous in proportion, than thoſe of <hi>Ireland;</hi> in ſo much, as that the City of <hi>London</hi> it ſelf may be thought to contain more people, than one half of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the beſt of times; But whether <hi>Ireland</hi> did (in its prime) contain two millions of people, or what more, I will not take upon me to determin, but do ſubmit the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of ſo doubtful a matter to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42941:89"/> more knowing perſons, together with the enquiry, whither in time to come (when <hi>Ireland</hi> ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited) it may be thought (though mixedly) the <hi>Engliſh</hi> may inhabit the proportion of about one Province and an half of it, though moſt numerous in the Provinces of <hi>Mounſter</hi> and <hi>Leinſter:</hi> The <hi>Iriſh</hi> the like proportion of one Province and an half more, though moſt numerous in the Province of <hi>Connnaght;</hi> And the <hi>Scots</hi> inhabiting the proportion of a fourth part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but more numerous in the Province of <hi>

               <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> tongue is ſharp and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious,<note place="margin">Their Language.</note> offereth great occaſion to quick Apothegms and proper alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherefore their common Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Bards, and Rymers, are ſaid to delight paſſingly thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the grace and propriety of the tongue. But the true <hi>Iriſh</hi> indeed differeth ſo much from that they they commonly ſpeak, that ſcarce one amongſt five ſcore, can either write, read, or underſtand it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is preſcribed among certain
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42941:90"/> their Poetes, and other Students of Antiquity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Italian, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Tongues are compounded of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. The <hi>German</hi> (high and low Country) <hi>Saxon, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> have great affinity. <hi>North-Wales, South-Wales, Cornwall,</hi> and Little <hi>Britain</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> as <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brenſis</hi> and Sir <hi>John Price</hi> have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly diſcourſed; but the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Redſhanks,</hi> and the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> of the <hi>High-lands</hi>) have affinity with no Tongue (as I can learn) more then with the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Language.</p>
               <p>Many reaſons there are to induce one to be of this opinion; firſt of all according to the firſt command, the <hi>Celtick</hi> Tongue was of force in all theſe Northern parts. <hi>Bodinus</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Celtick</hi> Language was all one. <hi>Pauſanius</hi> the <hi>Greecian</hi> maketh mention how the <hi>Celts</hi> in their Language called a Horſe <hi>Marc,</hi> and three Horſes, <hi>Trimarc;</hi> the which, the <hi>Welchman</hi> uſeth to this day with a guttural alteration, <hi>Margh,</hi> and <hi>Treemargh.</hi> Alſo <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> the learned Antiquary of this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42941:90"/> our Age, is of this opinion (remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Story of <hi>Gurguntius,</hi> and the infinite number of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Words in uſe among the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> the which he termeth <hi>infinitam vim Britannicarum dictionum</hi>) that the <hi>Britains</hi> firſt peopled this Land. And although of a long time (by reaſon of troubles, and alterations) the ſpeech grew wholly out of uſe; yet afterwards in ſucceſs of time it was revived. Secondly, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> oft <hi>Matched</hi> together, ſo that there grew among them great alliance and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity, to the fartherance of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Thirdly, the firſt Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seconds time, that brake the Ice into this Land, were <hi>Welch-men,</hi> whoſe Names and Seats to this day are freſh in memory. As for inſtance, in the Dioces of <hi>Leigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> there is a Town called <hi>Villa Wallicorum,</hi> the Town of <hi>Welch men.

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42941:91"/> 
                  <hi>Llis</hi> in <hi>Britiſh</hi> is a Court or Palace, of that in <hi>Ireland</hi> you have <hi>Liſmore, Lisfenyn, Liſlofty, Liſmakery.

               <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> are commonly of a large and handſome proportion of body, clear of Skin and Hue. Their Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are well Favoured, clear Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:42941:91"/> fair handed, big and large, ſuffered from their infancy to grow at Will, nothing curious of their feature and proportion of body.</p>
               <p>The Common ſort of People in <hi>Ireland</hi> do feed generally upon Milk,<note place="margin">Dyet.</note> Butter, Curds and Whey, New bread made of Oat meal, Beans, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Peaſe, and ſometimes of Wheat upon Feſtivals, their bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baked every day againſt the fire. Moſt of their Drink is Butter-milk and Whey; They feed much alſo upon Parſnips, Potatoes, and Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſſes, and in thoſe Countreys bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the Sea, upon Sea weeds, as Dulluſck, Slugane, but ſeldome eat Fleſh. The middle ſott of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Gentry differ not much from the ſame kind of Dyet, ſave only that they oftner feed upon Fleſh, eat better Bread, and drink Beer more frequently.

A moſt miſchievous and wicked act, not only tending to the dammage, and diſcouragement of the then preſent
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:42941:126" rendition="simple:additions"/> Adventurers, but even to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation of all the Chriſtians out of thoſe Countries.

How far the application of this Story may fit the Subject in hand as the matter ſtands in controverſie, between the Proteſtant party, and Papiſts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I refer to the conſideration of the judicious Reader.</p>
                  <p>The manner of Electing Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Men in this Kingdome,<note place="margin">Election.</note> is the ſame with that in <hi>England,</hi> but the Acts are drawn up and paſs'd diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, as alſo thoſe in <hi>Scotland</hi> where the Lords of the Articles, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Parliament is met, prepare the Bills, but here the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Councel uſually draw up ſuch Bills as they think fit, and tranſmit them to his Majeſty, and Councel in <hi>England,</hi> where they come under a new Debate, and if approved, returned back under

Each Houſe may reject them, or elſe muſt conſent to them <hi>in terminis</hi> without any alteration. When any Bills are thus by both Houſes agreed to, then they are preſented to the Lord Lieutenant who gives the Royal Aſſent.
